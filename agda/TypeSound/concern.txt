Trying to give a "direct" operational semantics to bidirectional type system is non-trivial

Thus we could argue

* Elaboration semantics (type erasure) to a standard type assignemnt with semantics, and the elaboration is type sound

if Γ ⊢d j # e : A ↝ M, then [Γ] ⊢ M : [A]
in STLC, [] is the identity function

this argument is kind of weak,

* Adopt type-directed operational semantics, which requires a partial value and value

p := λx. e | n
v := p : A

In this case we need to deal with (λx. x) 1 specially, but this is our novel part, not sure.
